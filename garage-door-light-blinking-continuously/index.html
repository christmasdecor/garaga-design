<p>Simply so why is my garage door opener light flashing. In this video from Sears PartsDirect well show you some simple fixes like checking the garage door openers alignment and clearing obstructions. The learn led will blink continually if there is radio frequency rf interference in the area. The constantly flashing wall button simply means that the door was either put into lock-out mode by someone using the wall panel control or for some reason it defaulted into lock-out. If you are referring to the small LED it is common for it to blink occasionally. If there is a safety reversing sensor issue the main lights flash 10 times. Pin On Awq.</p>
