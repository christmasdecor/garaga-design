<p>Its not just you. One of the more common DIY quick fix or hack is to use a hose clamp and some duct tape. This DIY fix will stop any cylinder based chairs for office or gaming from loweri. If that is not the issue then you might have to replace the pneumatic cylinder or the spring that helps with the height adjustment of your chair. I know this is not exactly a tech question but Im sure as there is a lot of people who game here there will be someone who has faced the problem of their gaming chair sinking to the base height by itself after extended usage for maybe a year or so. The valve that your seat height lever controls is controlled by a piston that lets air in and out. Sinking Computer Chair Can T Afford A New One Lifehacks.</p>
